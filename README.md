# Data-Preparation-JASP

## Overview
A systematic process of preparing raw data to be ready for analysis. This stage includes cleaning, transforming, integrating, and formatting the data to ensure that it is valid, reliable, and aligned with the requirements of the intended analysis.

## Objectives
- To ensure the validity and reliability of the data used in analysis.
- To reduce bias and noise that may affect the outcome of the analysis.
- To align the data structure with the requirements of statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to be applied.
- To save time during the analysis by providing data in a ready-to-use format.

## Stages
### 1.	 Data Collection
Gathering data from various sources such as surveys, information systems, external files, or APIs.

### 2.	Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values (imputation, deletion)
- Detecting and correcting duplicates or outliers
- Correcting spelling errors, input mistakes, and formatting issues

### 3.	Data Integration
Combining data from multiple sources into a consistent and unified dataset.

### 4.	Data Transformation
- Normalizing or standardizing values
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot or label encoding)
- Performing feature extraction and feature selection
- Applying scaling techniques (e.g., min-max, z-score)

### 5.	Data Reduction
Data reduction involves minimizing the complexity and volume of data without losing critical information. This process helps streamline analysis, reduce computational costs, and improve model performance. 
Common techniques for data reduction is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), sampling, and aggregation

### 6.	Data Formatting
Structuring the data into the required format, such as CSV, SQL, data frames, or arrays.

## Closing
Data preparation plays a crucial role in the overall success of data analysis. A well-prepared dataset can significantly enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of machine learning algorithms—by up to 80%—by ensuring that the input data is clean, consistent, and relevant.
