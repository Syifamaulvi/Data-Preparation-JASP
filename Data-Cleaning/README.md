# Data
There 77 row and 51 coloumn in the file. 
The columns include information such as gender, faed, maed, alg1, grades, mathach, ethnic, religion, competence, motivation, etc.

Many numeric values are still stored as strings with commas as decimals (e.g., 1,0 instead of 1.0). These need to be cleaned before processing.

## Data Cleaning
in this process we needs to replace commas , with dots . and convert to numeric data types, Remove irrelevant columns (e.g., No Data), Check for missing values and decide on a strategy (drop rows, impute with mean/median for numeric or mode for categorical).
